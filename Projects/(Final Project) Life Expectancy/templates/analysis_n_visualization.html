      There are 32 Developed countries and 161 Developing countries the Life Expectancy in developed countries is 79 and developing countries is 67 because developed countries are able to invest more on health care.
      Graph shows in both developing and developed countries maximum value is 89 and minimum value in developing countries is 38, In developed countries it is 70 where this is Maximum, Minimum values are calculated by using Inter quartile range.

    <p>Marshall Islands are investing in health care 17.2 percentage of income in health care which has life expectancy of 70.
       There are countries which are investing good percentage in health but still has less Life expectancy like Sierra Leone, Malawi, Lesotho, Burundi cause can be like this their income can be low or lack basic necessaries like Running water.</p>

      Life expectancy is more correlated with Schooling and Income composition of resources with 0.72 and 0.69 respectively.
      The following features are highly correlated: Under 5 deaths with Infant Deaths  ,Thinness 5-9 with Thinness 1-19.
      If a Feature is having correlation as 1 with any other feature, then that feature should be drop. It a kind of redundancy elimination.

      Life expectancy is more correlated with number of schooling years with 0.72. It can be demonstrate using below graph.In countries which have more no of schooling years has the Average Life expectancy at most 80 years and the graph is also consistent but in the countries which have a smaller number of schooling years has less Life expectancy. It is clear from the graph the maximum Life expectancy in a smaller number of schooling years countries is 69.

      The Countries which have a high-income composition of resources have a good Average in Life Expectancy compared to countries that have a low-Income composition of resources because the countryâ€™s productivity mainly depends on the Income composition of resources.
